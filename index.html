                        Chesspire is a free chess training program for kids in the Greater Pittsburgh hosted by professional high schoolers. 
                    We provide a fun and engaging environment for kids to learn chess and improve their skills.
                    We also give out prizes to the top competitors at each tournament (hosted weekly) and provide a free lunch for all participants.

                        This summer, we're hosting a training camp with two divisions, the Cubs and the Tigers. 
                    The cubs are for introductory chess players, where they will learn how to play the game and basic tactics.
                    The tigers are for more advanced chess players, where you will learn more theory, advanced plays, and gambits.
